# roadmap/todos
* [x] [config hierarchy](#config-hierarchy)  
  * [x] re-locate config
  * [ ] remove gulp argsv from config hierarchy
    * [ ] rewrite README for new config hierarchy
  * [ ] extended use of config module
    * [ ] use hot module port and other server vars from config
  * [ ] webpack
    * [x] make hotserverBuild synchronous (use gulp-nodemon)
      * [ ] wait until nodemon script is finished (.on('start') is too early)  
      see: https://github.com/DoubleU23/gulp-webpack-react-env/blob/master/gulp/tasks/webpack.js#L37
    * [ ] make production build synchronous
    * [ ] clean and format webpack task leftovers
* [x] browserSync
  * [ ] start browserSync after webpack has built OR reload browserSync afterwards (how to wait for build!?)
* [ ] store implementation (mobx?)
* [x] server rendering  
  * [ ] server-side async prefetching
  * [ ] store injection/binding
  * [ ] dynamic template

* [ ] sublime enhancements
    * [x] ESLint-Formatter
    * [ ] setup/enhance align plugin and run it on pre_save on the whole file
      [ ] fix colon alignments
      [ ] ignore JSX

# gulp tasks
task `lint`: runs eslint with babel-eslint and some extended rules based on the "standard" ruleset

* [x] `gulp lint`
* [ ] webpack
  * [x] start dev-server with HMR
  * [x] production build
     * [ ] starting production server

# config

config.js uses (some vars from) process.env vars injected by gulp (args) which are preset by config-module vars that can be overwritten by command-line/ENV vars (f.e. set by GITLAB CI)  
so... most basic defaults are set in the config module files and will be used in gulp args defaults and in config.js defaults

### config-hierarchy

1. command-line injected env vars
  * highest priority to enable custom start/build scripts and CI builds
  * f.e. `APP_ENV=development gulp`
2. config module files ([node-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) package)
  * can be overwritten by env vars (see `custom-environment-variables.yml`)
  * loading config file corresponding to `NODE_ENV`
  * f.e. /config/production.yml
3. gulp args
    * overwrites config modules vars
    * get injected into apps `process.env`
    * f.e. `gulp --env production`
4. config.js defaults
    * contains app-related config vars that aren't env-dependent - like paths and file extensions
    * uses APP_ENV for isDevelopment switch

### Sublime Text

__auto format__ according to your rules defined in .eslintrc:
> * use [ESLint-Formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ESLint-Formatter) to format by shortcut `[Ctrl + Shift + H]`
> * use [Sublime-Hooks](https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-hooks) to format on pre-save
just add the following setting to your user-setting file:  
`"on_pre_save_async_user": [{"command": "format_eslint"}] // has to be async`

> bug: has problems with react/jsx-indent for "hardcoded" plaintext in JSX structure
(no problem if you use `{varname}`)

# issues
__HMR/Router Bug__

> HMR has a known issue with updating the Router which blocks the reloading:  
`Warning: You cannot change <Router history>; it will be ignored`  
see f.e. https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/2704

> **WORKAROUND**
until this is (officially) fixxed, here is the workaround:
after starting the dev-server you have to save the /app/index.js file ONCE
after that you can happily save childcomponents with a running HMR

__ESLINT - indent__
> [MemberExpression](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent#memberexpression) rule is ignored on assignments
"// Any indentation is permitted in variable declarations and assignments."
> right indent on return statements

__ESLINT - func-style__
> enforcing by ESLint-Formatter is broken in __test__ dir...  
maybe it's intended like this to reserve the context?
